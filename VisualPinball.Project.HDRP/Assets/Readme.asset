  title: Visual Pinball Engine - HDRP Project
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: 'This project is for table playing and editing with <b>High-end Graphics</b>.
      It is developed for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11 and above).
      This project utilizes Unity''s <b>High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)</b>,
      a modern rendering pipeline that includes advanced material types and realistic
      lighting models. This project also includes a default table with usage examples
      as well as the shared asset library package.  This project does not currently
      include support for VR or Raytracing (DXR) features. '

  - heading: VPE Shared Asset Library
    text: The VPE Shared Asset Library package contains materials and models that
      can be used directly in table builds.   It is intended to be used to abstract
      the material based objects on a table, such as plastic posts, various metals
      etc.  Using the materials can reduce the amount of work required to generate
      a quality table as well as reduce the download size.  Only table assets that
      require specific scans for decals will need to be generated.

    text: '    This project sets up the editor, scene and render pipeline settings
      to provide a consistent working base for all VPE tables.  This ensures that
      all tables will look correct when viewed in the final player.  '

  - heading: 
    text: '     Included in this project a <b> Light Environment Editor </b>.  This
      allows you to preview different lighting conditions for your table.  The lighting
      environment for the game will be separate from the tables, allowing the player
      choose what their preferred lighting setup is.  This tool allows you to quickly
      change between different lighting scenarios to test your table and make sure
      it looks exactly as you intend it to in a wide variety of situations.  The
      window for this can be found under the Visual Pinball menu on the top menu
      bar.  '

      it is possible to setup, this is not well documented and requires a lot of
      manual configuration.  It is not recommended for use at this time with VPE.
