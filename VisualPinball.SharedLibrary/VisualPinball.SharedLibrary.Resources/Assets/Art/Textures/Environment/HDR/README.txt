These are intended for use during table development to test tables under different lighting conditions.  These are not intended for use in a shipping table and will be stripped when the table is saved.  Table lighting is handled by the VPE Front-end player and will be controlled by the player.  

Most of these have a neutral white balance.  A few others are provided for testing in warmer or colder toned environments.
